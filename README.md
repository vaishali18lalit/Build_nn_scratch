# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch
### Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a neural network from scratch, without relying on any standard inbuilt libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. By building a neural network from the ground up, we gain a deeper understanding of its underlying principles and mechanics.

### Features
Custom Implementation: We develop every component of the neural network, including layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms, from scratch using Python.

#### Modular Design: 
The codebase is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend. Each module encapsulates specific functionalities, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

#### Flexibility: 
Users can experiment with different network architectures, activation functions, and optimization techniques by tweaking parameters in the code. This flexibility allows for a deeper exploration of neural network behavior and performance.

#### Contents
Neural Network Architecture: Define the structure of the neural network, including the number of layers, neurons per layer, and connectivity between layers.

#### Activation Functions:
Implement various activation functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh, allowing users to choose the activation function best suited for their application.

#### Loss Functions:
Implement popular loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy Loss, enabling efficient training and evaluation of the neural network.

#### Optimization Algorithms: 
Implement optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent and its variants (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent) for training the neural network and updating model parameters.

#### Training Pipeline: 
Develop a training pipeline to iteratively train the neural network on labeled datasets, monitor performance metrics, and adjust model parameters to improve accuracy.
